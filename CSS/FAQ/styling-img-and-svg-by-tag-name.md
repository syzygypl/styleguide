## Styling `img` and `svg` by tag name

In some cases there is no reasonable solution to add a class name to those elements.
An example **might be** `svg` included directly in TWIG template or `img` received
directly from WYSIWYG.

_**However** - if adding a class name to those elements does not sound like an
overengineering we should always style by a class name._
