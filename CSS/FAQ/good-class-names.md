Class names should be named is semantic way to make code more readable - represent the purpose
of an element, not it's visual appearance.
You never know if the layout you are working on currently will not change it's visual appearance
one day. That's why `.button--primary` will always be a better name than `.button--red` so you
don't have to refactor all your markup after all. Believe me or not but it happens!
